# Base Byte
A base 256 (and beyond) vector numeral system intended for UTF8 or ASCII visual identity for characters on character maps and a useful alternative to decimal.

## Similarities
This is a take on binary (like hexadecimal) It is also similar to octal in that it is 2^8, thus dealing with 8 bits. It is also 16^2 so it can fit nicely as a square. Sadly it is not divisible by 3, however 2^10 is so that may be the next revision.

## Differences
This is not your fingers or your toes. The number ten should be the last thing on your mind (instead the scientific notation). This is also not something arbitrary.

## Numpad
An interface is needed, so let's look at the numpad. You will need keys 1-9. 0 could be used in place of the number 5. If you only have the number row I would suggest skipping 9. You need each finger on 2 keys and depress up to 8 number keys simultaneously, or up to 2 per finger.

## Character Design
Each bit is to be represented by a complete vertical yet simple base symbol. The current base symbols are ^, L, (, /, \, ), 7, and |. - is not used to remove confusion with the tack which could represent a form of null, or even subtraction. Combined these form a full character similar to how a row of 8 lights could represent a byte, or hex up to FF. Sadly hex is not always explicit, nor is binary easy to follow, parse, or display. I would prefer a 1 to 1 character to character representation for my basic needs in character mapping and thus feel I am not alone on this matter. Unfortunately, all on is exceptionally cluttered and there is still work to do on simple elegant hybrids.

## Pizza
An easy example is needed to convey, and hilariously pie comes to save the day. As we all know, pie is not 3.14 it is 8; 8 slices. Or 16 if you are a younger programmer (but let's not get off topic just yet). However programmers don't eat most types of pie, they prefer pizza obviously because it can be delivered to their domains. If you look at the remnants of pizza you see a box full of pizza slice shaped grease stains. This can serve as the off position, and you could add back in more slices to serve as the on positions. Off is vital so others know you are working with pizza in the first place. Interesting you can have 256 configurations of a pizza using the standard cutting method.

I also like pepperoni on my Base Byte Pizza due to the fact not only are they excessively greasy but also that if needed you could put 8 of them on each slice. Why? Well what positions are the slices in? Where is the first bit? Go with what everyone knows and set it up like a clock with only 8 hours. Back to how greasy those meat slices are so if there are no slices you could still see what it should look like.
